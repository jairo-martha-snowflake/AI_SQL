The service was friendly and attentive, if a bit slow at times, but the cozy atmosphere and delicious food more than made up for it. Overall, I'd highly recommend Lutz-Williams Saigon for a satisfying and authentic Vietnamese meal - just be prepared for a wait, especially on weekends."" 4/5 stars",Lutz-Williams Saigon,Vietnamese,$$$$,Uptown,Upper East Side,North,10AM - 11PM,true,true,2024-07-31,Jessica Navarro,chenmeghan@example.org,2023-11-15,Chinese,Lake James,ID,false

The pad thai I ordered was a soggy, flavorless mess, with overcooked noodles and a cloying sweetness that dominated the dish. The ""spicy"" tom yum soup was similarly disappointing, with a heat level that was more akin to a gentle simmer than a fiery blaze. For the prices they're charging, I expect a lot more than the bland, uninspired fare that Thomas-Johnson is serving up.",Thomas-Johnson,Thai,$$$$,West Side,Riverside,West,11AM - 12PM,false,true,2024-01-01,Gerald Lopez,jennifer27@example.net,2024-11-25,American,South Theresaview,MI,false

The moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy ambiance that set the tone for a wonderful evening. The service was top-notch, with our server expertly guiding us through the menu and making spot-on recommendations. The food was truly exceptional, with the Kung Pao chicken and pan-seared dumplings standing out as highlights - the flavors were bold, the presentation was beautiful, and the portions were generous. Overall, I'd give Newton, Graham and Andrade 4.5 stars - it's a must-visit for any Chinese food lover, and a great choice for special occasions.""","Newton, Graham and Andrade",Chinese,$$,Suburb,Pine Hills,Outer,8AM - 9PM,true,true,2024-12-14,Carlos Reilly,hweeks@example.net,2023-05-29,Mediterranean,West Kristin,WI,true

As a pescatarian with a gluten intolerance, I was thrilled to find a separate gluten-free menu that didn't sacrifice an ounce of flavor. The chef's selection of sashimi-grade tuna and scallops was sublime, and the vegan 'dragon roll' was a game-changer - who knew tofu could be so decadent? The service was attentive and knowledgeable, with our server happily guiding us through the menu's many options. Overall, a flawless 5-star experience that has left me eager to return.""","Ward, Singh and Mullins",Japanese,$,Suburb,Pine Hills,Outer,7AM - 11PM,true,true,2024-08-14,Walter Clements,ksmith@example.net,2024-05-13,Italian,Mccoyside,SD,true
